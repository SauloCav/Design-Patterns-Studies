Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.

All problems that we’ve just experienced are caused by broken encapsulation. Some objects try to do more than they are supposed to. To collect the data required to perform some action, they invade the private space of other objects instead of letting these objects perform the actual action.

The Memento pattern delegates creating the state snapshots to the actual owner of that state, the originator object. Hence, instead of other objects trying to copy the editor’s state from the “outside,” the editor class itself can make the snapshot since it has full access to its own state.

The pattern suggests storing the copy of the object’s state in a special object called memento. The contents of the memento aren’t accessible to any other object except the one that produced it. Other objects must communicate with mementos using a limited interface which may allow fetching the snapshot’s metadata (creation time, the name of the performed operation, etc.), but not the original object’s state contained in the snapshot.
